  <h3>📘 Why v1.0 — Foundations Was Essential for My Career</h3>

  <p>
    Learning computer science fundamentals was not only an academic milestone —
    it became the architecture behind everything I build today. Understanding how
    systems behave internally (CPU, memory, processes, networks, databases)
    shaped the way I design, debug, and scale software.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Here’s what this stage enabled:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Systems Thinking:</strong> I learned to see problems as connected components instead of isolated bugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture Awareness:</strong> I now design solutions based on performance, resource flow, and system constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Better Decision-Making:</strong> I can evaluate trade-offs between memory, CPU, I/O, and concurrency.</li>
    <li><strong>Tool-Builder Mindset:</strong> The diagram above reflects my ability to turn complex ideas into clear, structured explanations.</li>
    <li><strong>Career Foundations:</strong> Everything I built after v1.0 (APIs, backend, cloud, scalability) relies on these fundamentals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This section exists to show recruiters and engineers how I think: 
    not just as a coder, but as someone who understands how systems truly work.
    v1.0 is the version where I learned to think like an engineer — and that
    mindset continues to drive every project I take on.
